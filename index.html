            <h3 class="centeredcol">Culinary delights</h3>
            <p class="centeredcol">Thanks to its inventive and visionary chefs, myriad cultural influences, and an incredible natural bounty, the food in Puerto Rico is as exciting and diverse as the island itself. In fact, there's so much good food here that anyone who settles for mediocre resort fare instead of sampling the island's incredible culinary offerings should not be allowed on to an airplane to leave until they do. Whether you're after homestyle comida criolla, fresh-off-the-boat seafood, something elegant paired with a beautiful French wine or boundary-pushing gastronomy, there's a restaurant in Puerto Rico to suit your taste, mood, or price point.</p>
